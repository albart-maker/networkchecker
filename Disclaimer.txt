### **Phase 2: Upload to GitHub**

Now, let's push it.

1.  **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in.
2.  Click the **+** icon (top right) -> **New Repository**.
3.  Name it `HomeGuard`.
4.  **Do not** check "Add a README" (we already made one).
5.  Click **Create repository**.

Now, go back to your **PowerShell (Administrator)** window in your project folder and run these commands one by one:

```powershell
# 1. Initialize Git
git init

# 2. Add your files (The .gitignore will stop the messy files from being added)
git add .

# 3. Save the snapshot
git commit -m "Initial commit - Network Scanner V1"

# 4. Set the branch name
git branch -M main

# 5. Connect to your GitHub (REPLACE THIS URL WITH THE ONE GITHUB GAVE YOU)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HomeGuard.git

# 6. Push the code
git push -u origin main
